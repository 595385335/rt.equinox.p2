<body>
Describes high level provisioning operations that can be resolved and performed
either modally or in the background.  Additional operations are defined for 
lower level provisioning tasks such as managing provisioning repositories.
Operation-level events are published so that clients can respond to the operation
as a whole rather than the fine-grained events that are published by the core
components during the operation.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package consists of several kinds of operations and supporting classes:
<ol>
<li><b>Profile Change Operations</b> describe high level provisioning operations that
modify a profile.  These operations generally are performed in two phases, the resolution
of the operation, followed by the provisioning of the resolved operation.  Both the
resolution and the provisioning tasks can be performed either modally or as jobs.
</li>
<li><b>Repository Jobs</b> manage the addition, removal, loading, or refreshing of one
or more repositories.  The jobs provide all the necessary infrastructure for progress
monitor management and high-level event notification.  The jobs can be run modally
or scheduled as a platform job.
</li>
<li><b>Operation Events</b> are published as operations start and complete.  Clients
of p2 that perform operations can listen to these events rather than the corresponding
core events as a way of batching their response to the intermediate events.
</li>
<li><b>ProvisioningSession</b> represents a particular instance of a p2 provisioning
system.  It provides access to all of the p2 core services as well as utility methods
for commonly performed provisioning tasks.
</li>
</ol>
